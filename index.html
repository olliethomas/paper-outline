    <h1>Paper Outline Template</h1>

    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Don't write an abstract. This can be done when the paper is complete.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>N.B. The first paragraph or two should be written out completely. Pay particular attention to the opening sentence. Ideally, it should state concisely the objective of the work, and indicate why this objective is important.</p>

    <h3>The objectives of the work</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h3>The justification for these objectives. Why is this work important?</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Who else has done what?</li>
        <p>Text here...</p>

        <li>How?</li>
        <p>Text here...</p>

        <li>What have we done previously?</li>
        <p>Text here...</p>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional text here...</p>

    <h3>Guidance to the reader</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What should the reader watch for in the paper?</li>
        <p>Text here...</p>

        <li>What are the interesting points / highlights?</li>
        <p>Text here...</p>

        <li>What strategy did we use?</li>

    <h3>Summary / Conclusion. What should the reader expect as a conclusion?</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Include, in the correct order to correspond to the order in the Results section,
                all of the paragraph subheadings of the Methods section.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>This sections should be organised according to major topics.
            The separate parts should have subheadings to make the organisation clear.
            Try to make these headings as specific and information-rich as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In the outline, do not write a significant amount of text, but get all the data in their proper place:
                Any text should simply indicate what will go in that section.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remember to think of a paper as a collection of experimental results,
                summarised as clearly and economically as possible in figures, tables, equations, and schemes.
                The text in the paper serves just to explain the data, and is secondary.
                The more information can be compressed into tablets, equations, etc.,
                the shorter and more readable the paper will be.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Figures (with captions)</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h3>Schemes (with captions and footnotes)</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h3>Equations</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h3>Tables (correctly formatted)</h3>
    <p>Text here...</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Try to summarise the conclusions of the paper as a list of short phrases or sentences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The conclusion section should be a conclusion, not a summary.
            It should add a new, higher level of analysis, and should indicate explicitly the significance of the work.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Points of Style</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Do not use nouns as adjectives.</li>
        <li>Describe experimental results uniformly in the past tense .</li>
        <li>Use active voice whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Complete all comparisons.</li>
